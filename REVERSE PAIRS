Intuition
We will be using the Merge Sort Algorithm to solve this problem. We split the whole array into 2 parts creating a Merge Sort Tree-like structure. During the conquer step we do the following task :

-> We take the left half of the Array and Right half of the Array, both are sorted in themselves.

-> We will be checking the following condition arr[i] <= 2*arr[j] where i is the pointer in the Left Array and j is the pointer in the Right Array.

-> If at any point arr[i] <= 2*arr[j] , we add 1 to the answer as this pair has a contribution to the answer.

-> If Left Array gets exhausted before Right Array we keep on adding the distance j pointer traveled as both the arrays are Sorted so the next ith element from Left Subarray will equally contribute to the answer.

The moment when both Arrays get exhausted we perform a merge operation. This goes on until we get the original array as a Sorted array.

Approach
We, first of all, call a Merge Sort function, in that we recursively call Left Recursion and Right Recursion after that we call the Merge function in order to merge both Left and Right Calls we initially made and compute the final answer.

-> In the Merge function, we will be using low, mid, and high values to count the total number of inversion pairs for the Left half and Right half of the Array.

-> Now, after the above task, we need to Merge the both Left and Right sub-arrays using a temporary vector.

-> After this, we need to copy back the temporary vector to the Original Array. Then finally we return the number of pairs we counted.

Complexity
Time complexity: O( N log N ) + O (N) + O (N)
Reason: O(N) – Merge operation, O(N) – counting operation ( at each iteration of i, j doesn’t start from 0 . Both of them move linearl

Space complexity: O(N)
Reason : O(N) – Temporary vector

Code
class Solution {
public:
  int Merge(vector < int > & nums, int low, int mid, int high) {
  int total = 0;
  int j = mid + 1;
  for (int i = low; i <= mid; i++) {
    while (j <= high && nums[i] > 2LL * nums[j]) {
      j++;
    }
    total += (j - (mid + 1));
  }

  vector < int > t;
  int left = low, right = mid + 1;

  while (left <= mid && right <= high) {

    if (nums[left] <= nums[right]) {
      t.push_back(nums[left++]);
    } else {
      t.push_back(nums[right++]);
    }
  }

  while (left <= mid) {
    t.push_back(nums[left++]);
  }
  while (right <= high) {
    t.push_back(nums[right++]);
  }

  for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
    nums[i] = t[i - low];
  }
  return total;
}
int MergeSort(vector < int > & nums, int low, int high) {

  if (low >= high) return 0;
  int mid = (low + high) / 2;
  int inv = MergeSort(nums, low, mid);
  inv += MergeSort(nums, mid + 1, high);
  inv += Merge(nums, low, mid, high);
  return inv;
}
int reversePairs(vector < int > & arr) {
  return MergeSort(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);
}
};
